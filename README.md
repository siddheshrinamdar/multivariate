The Diabetes Dataset
#Description : The diabetes dataset that has been taken from kaggle consists of different variable such as BMI, AGE,INSULIN, 
SKIN THICKNESS, GLUCOSE,DIABETES PEDIGREE FUNCTION. We clean this data and apply different analysis types and visualizations
to find out which factors of the variabes lead to Diabettes in a person.

What exactly do I want to find out? 
The database consists of various medical factors that will tells us if a female is diabetic or non-diabetic.Build different models which will fit the data and will help us accurately predict if the females has diabetes or not.

How are the various measurements related?
we can understand the relationship between the variables with the help of the correlogram matrix. The correlogram matrix shows correlation coefficients between each variable. A positive correlation coeeficient shows that they are directly proportional to each and negative coeffiecinet shows that they are inversely proportional.

Does number of Pregnancies has an impact over diabetes outcome? 
plotting preganancies against outcome will show how strongly they are correlated.

What does the data 'look' like? Does it follow any known probability distributions? 
The dataset looks like it is complete and has no missing value. Missingness can be found using the missingmap function. Looking the data , I can plot histograms to check if the data is right or left skewed and perform transformations accordingly.Histograms help us give the distribution of the data. Using Distribution tests can also help us find the probability distribution the data follows. Considering p-value as 0.05, wee can check if the distributions have null hypothesis or an alternate hypothesis.
